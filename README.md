inclined-plane
==============

Yet another cheap and simple dependency injection library for TypeScript.

## Installation

Just like you'd expect:

```bash
npm install --save inclined-plane
```

## Usage

Define a perfectly normal interface.
You probably want to export it.

```typescript
export interface Logger {
  debug(message: string): void;
}
```

Create the `InjectableType` version **with the same name**:

```typescript
import {injectableType} from 'inclined-plane';

export interface Logger {
  debug(message: string): void;
}

export const Logger = injectableType<Logger>('Logger');
```

Yes, the syntax there is a little redundant because we need both compile- and run-time type information.

The type identifier can now be used to produce decorators:

| Decorator | Target | Example | Intent |
| --------- | ------ | ------- | ------ |
| `.implementation` | Class | <code>@Logger.implementation<br>class LoggerImpl implements Logger {</code> | The decorated class is an implementation of the type. |
| `.accessor` | Method | <code>class LoggerBuilder {<br>@Logger.accessor<br>buildLogger(): Logger {</code> | The decorated instance method can be called to get instances of the type. |
| `.supplier` | Method | <code>class LoggerBuilder {<br>@Logger.supplier<br>static buildLogger(): Logger {</code> | The decorated static method can be called to get instances of the type. |
| `.required` | Param | <code>constructor(<br>@Logger.required private readonly logger: Logger<br>) {}</code> | A value of that type for the parameter is required. |
| `.optional` | Param | (same as above) | A value of that type should be provided, or undefined if not available. |
| `.inject` | Property | <code>class Whatever {<br>@Logger.inject private readonly logger?: Logger;</code> | A value of that type should be injected into that property. |

### Implementations: `.implementation`, `.supplier`, and `.accessor`

Given a normal service/bean/component which you **don't** need to export, identify it by decorating it:

```typescript
import {Logger} from './path/to/Logger';

@Logger.implementation
class ConsoleLogger implements Logger {
  debug(message: string) {
    console.log(message);
  }
}
```

Or decorate an instance method:

```typescript
class LoggerBuilder {
  @Logger.accessor
  public buildLogger(): Logger {
    return new ConsoleLogger();
  } 
}
```

Or decorate a static method:

```typescript
class LoggerBuilder {
  @Logger.supplier
  public static buildLogger(): Logger {
    return new ConsoleLogger();
  }
}
```

It can now be automagically instantiated and injected.
You can get a managed instance from the `InjectableType` instance or from the `buildInstance` function for classes that aren't decorated as providers:

```typescript
import {buildInstance} from 'inclined-plane';
import {Logger} from './path/to/Logger';
import {WidgetService} from './path/to/WidgetService';

const logger = Logger.getInstance();  // will be a ConsoleLogger
const widgetService = buildInstance(WidgetService);
```

If you have multiple providers for a given type, you can ask for all of them with `getInstances()`:

```typescript
const loggers = Logger.getInstances();
```

Note that this will return an empty array if no providers have been loaded/imported.

In your main/index, you'll want to ensure that you `import` all your injectable services/beans/components.
Because they are not directly referenced, they won't be seen unless their files are imported!

```typescript
import './path/to/ConsoleLogger';
```

You don't need to do anything moreâ€”just import the file.
Generally, this is easiest to do by defining a file like `services.ts` or `implementations.ts` that lists all injectable imports, then include that one file from your main/index.

### Parameters: `.required` and `.optional`

Constructor parameters can be decorated for injection:

```typescript
import {DatabaseAdapter} from './path/to/DatabaseAdapter';
import {Logger} from './path/to/Logger';

export class WidgetService {
  constructor(
    @DatabaseAdapter.require private readonly db: DatabaseAdapter,
    @Logger.optional private readonly logger: Logger,
  ) {}
}
```

### Dependency Cycles and Properties: `.inject`

Sometimes your type system will end up complex enough to have cycles:

```typescript
interface Left {
  right: Right | undefined;
}
interface Right {
  left: Left | undefined;
}

const Left = injectableType<Left>('Left');
const Right = injectableType<Right>('Right');

@Left.implementation
class LeftImpl implements Left {
  constructor(@Right.required private readonly right?: Right) {}
}

@Right.implementation
class RightImpl implements Right {
  constructor(@Left.required private readonly left?: Left) {}
}

```

When attempting to build an instance you'll see a message like:

> Dependency cycle detected while trying to build ...

You can break these cycles by moving injected items from constructor parameters to properties with the `.inject` decorator:

```typescript
class LeftImpl {
  @Right.inject private readonly right: Right | undefined;
}
class RightImpl {
  @Left.inject private readonly left: Left | undefined;
}
```

## Use `postConstruct` for delayed initialization

Properties values injected via `.inject` are not available in the constructor:

```typescript
class LeftImpl {
  @Right.inject private readonly right: Right | undefined;
  
  constructor() {
    console.log(this.right);  // undefined
  }
}
```

Instead, you can define a `postConstruct()` method (see the `ManagedInstance` interface) to be called when all managed values have been injected:

```typescript
import {ManagedInstance} from 'inclined-plane';

class LeftImpl implements ManagedInstance {
  @Right.inject private readonly right: Right | undefined;
  
  protected postConstruct() {
    console.log(this.right);  // not undefined
  }
}
```

Generally, you'll want to make this `protected` so it's not visible to other types, but you can still call it from subclasses for testing purposes.

Note that `.inject` has the same semantics as `.optional` and **not** `.required`: it will silently allow an `undefined` value if no providers can be found for the type.
Add a guard condition in `postConstruct()` to detect `undefined` if necessary.

## Questions

 * **Can I inject implementations based on type parameters?**
 
   Nope.
   You're trying to do something like this, right?
   
   ```typescript
   interface Enclosure<T> { /* ... */ }
   interface Animal { /* ... */ }

   const Enclosure = injectableType<Enclosure<any>>('Enclosure');

   class ZooBuilding {
     constructor(
       @Enclosure.require private readonly animalEnclosure: Enclosure<Animal>,
     ) {}
   }
   ```
   
   There are no plans to support this any time soon, as the complete lack of runtime type info makes this painful if not impossible.
