==============

Yet another cheap and simple dependency injection library for TypeScript.

## Usage

Define a perfectly normal interface.
You probably want to export it.

```typescript
export interface Logger {
  debug(message: string): void;
}
```

Create the `InjectableType` version **with the same name**:

```typescript
import {injectableType} from 'inclined-plane';

export interface Logger {
  debug(message: string): void;
}

export const Logger = injectableType<Logger>('Logger');
```

Yes, the syntax there is a little redundant because we need both compile- and run-time type information.

Given a normal service/bean/component which you **don't** need to export, identify it by decorating it:

```typescript
import {Logger} from './path/to/Logger';

@Logger.provider
class ConsoleLogger implements Logger {
  debug(message: string) {
    console.log(message);
  }
}
```

It can now be automagically instantiated and injected via constructor parameters:

```typescript
import {DatabaseAdapter} from './path/to/DatabaseAdapter';
import {Logger} from './path/to/Logger';

export class WidgetService {
  constructor(
    @DatabaseAdapter.require private readonly db: DatabaseAdapter,
    @Logger.optional private readonly logger: Logger,
  ) {}
}
```

You can get a managed instance from the `InjectableType` instance or from the `buildInstance` function for unmanaged types:

```typescript
import {buildInstance} from 'inclined-plane';
import {Logger} from './path/to/Logger';
import {WidgetService} from './path/to/WidgetService';

const logger = Logger.getInstance();  // will be a ConsoleLogger
const widgetService = buildInstance(WidgetService);
```

If you have multiple providers for a given type, you can ask for all of them with `getInstances()`:

```typescript
const loggers = Logger.getInstances();
```

Note that this will return an empty array if no providers have been loaded/imported.

In your main/index, you'll want to ensure that you `import` all your injected services/beans/components.
Because they are not directly referenced, they won't be seen unless their files are imported!

```typescript
import './path/to/ConsoleLogger';
```

You don't need to do anything moreâ€”just import the file.
Generally, this is easiest to do by defining a file like `services.ts` or `implementations.ts` that lists all injectable imports, then include that one file from your main/index.

## Questions

 * **Can I inject implementations based on type parameters?**
 
   Nope.
   You're trying to do something like this, right?
   
   ```typescript
   interface Enclosure<T> { /* ... */ }
   interface Animal { /* ... */ }

   const Enclosure = injectableType<Enclosure<any>>('Enclosure');

   class Widget {
     constructor(
       @Enclosure.require private readonly animalEnclosure: Enclosure<Animal>,
     ) {}
   }
   ```
   
   There are no plans to support this any time soon, as the complete lack of runtime type info makes this painful if not impossible.
